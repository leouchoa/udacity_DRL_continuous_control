## About the Project

The goal of the project is to train an agent to maintain a double-jointed arm at target locations for as many time steps as possible, as we can see from the animation bellow.

To do that a reinforcement learning agent was trained. Specifically it was trained using a Deep Neural Network, with a technique called DDPG, similar as was presented in the original [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971v6) paper.
